### What?
configuration for my Void Linux installations.
also masochism.
### Why?
to feel pain.
### How?
- spent 2 days making a bootstrapping script in `dash`.
- spent my holiday adding patches to each branch for "consistency".
- just made [unass](https://github.com/Skaytacium/unass).
- lmao that's gone, [xbps-src](https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages) and [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) now.
